Week 1 Project:
    This first week's exercise will help us brush up on Git and start practicing some Javascript. In the Week 1 folder
there is a file named 'github.js' that you will be editing.Each person will complete one of the 'person' functions: which will take in an array of strings, iterate through it,
and print out to the terminal some of their favorite things. Pair up in a group of two or three to work on this Exercise.    
     Each partner  will create a github repo for all of their Source work. In this repo, one person can copy the file 'github.js'
and put it in their own repo. The other partner(s) will then clone the repo, checkout a branch on git, and edit the  'github.js' file.
Once each person has made their changes on their own branch, push the branch up to github, submit a pull request, and merge it with develop.
By the end of the exercise, each of you should be able to pull down the code from the develop branch, run it, and see all of the changes!
