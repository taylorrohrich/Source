Week 5 Project:
This week's exercise will be a bit more open-ended: find some neat API on the internet, grab some data from it via axios,
and display it in a React app in a cool way! If you have time, try to practice using multiple React components: for example,
make the axios api call in 'App.js' and pass it down to be displayed to a child component. For a bonus challenge, you can try to make the api call based off of user input.
